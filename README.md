# ecal-camera-samples

The ecal-camera-samples is a set of projects around sending and receiving image data with [eCAL](https://eclipse-ecal.github.io/ecal/).

After installation, you have 2 components available:

1. A **sender application** `ecal_camera_snd` that publishes the data of a webcam device to an eCAL topic
2. A **monitor plugin** that can display the image data in the eCAL Monitor

# How to install prebuilt binaries

1. [Install eCAL](https://eclipse-ecal.github.io/ecal/getting_started/setup.html) (obviously ðŸ˜‰)
2. Go to the [release page](https://github.com/eclipse-ecal/ecal-camera-samples/releases) and pick the version matching your OS and eCAL Version

3. **Windows**: Copy the content of the zip archive to the bin directory of your eCAL Installation, probably at `C:\eCAL\bin\`

    **Ubuntu**: Install the dependencies and the downloaded .deb installer:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install ecal libqt5multimedia5-plugins
    sudo dpkg -i ecal-camera-samples*.deb

```

Command Line:
```
topicName:        Name of the eCAL Topic to publish to
cameraName:       Path to camera. Call --list-cameras to list
                  available cameras. 
resolutionWidth:  Image width (optional) 
resolutionHeight: Image height (optional) 
maxFps:           Maximal framerate (optional)

--help:           Print this help
